## Features
- âœ… **Interactive conversation** - Chat with the RAG in real-time
- âœ… **Database persistence** - All messages saved and retrieved from database
- âœ… **Context accumulation** - RAG remembers previous conversation turns
- âœ… **Vehicle display** - Shows found vehicles with formatting
- âœ… **Debug mode** - Toggle detailed RAG decision info
- âœ… **Clean exit** - Automatically clears test data on exit
- âœ… **Color-coded** - Easy to distinguish customer/agent messages

## Installation

No external dependencies needed! Uses built-in Python ANSI color codes.

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python scripts/interactive_rag_test.py
```

### With Specific Dealership

ðŸ”„ Initializing RAG testing environment...
âœ… RAG system initialized
âœ… Test lead created: abc-123-def
âœ… Connected to dealership: 23c7eafa-7497-427f-9d43-c084e465c059

Start chatting! Type your message below:

ðŸ‘¤ YOU: I'm looking for a sedan

ðŸ¤– RAG: Got it - sedan. What's your budget range?

## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Budget-Only Query (Should Ask Questions)
```
ðŸ‘¤ YOU: I'm interested in cars under $30k
ðŸ¤– RAG: Perfect - $30k gives you lots of options. What type are you looking for?
```

### Test 2: Budget + Type (Should Show Vehicles)
```
ðŸ‘¤ YOU: Show me sedans under $25k
ðŸ¤– RAG: [Shows 3-5 sedans with prices]
```

### Test 3: Specific Model (Should Show Immediately)
```
ðŸ‘¤ YOU: Do you have any Honda Civics?
ðŸ¤– RAG: [Shows Honda Civics]
```

### Test 4: Multi-Turn Context Accumulation
```
ðŸ‘¤ YOU: I need something reliable
ðŸ¤– RAG: What type of vehicle are you looking for?

ðŸ‘¤ YOU: Sedan
ðŸ¤– RAG: What's your budget?

ðŸ‘¤ YOU: $25k
ðŸ¤– RAG: [Shows sedans under $25k - remembered "sedan" from 2 turns ago]
```

## Debug Mode

Enable debug mode to see RAG decision-making:

```
ðŸ‘¤ YOU: debug on
ðŸ”§ Debug mode enabled

ðŸ‘¤ YOU: Show me sedans

  ðŸš— Found 5 vehicles:
    1. 2020 Honda Civic - $23,500
    ...

ðŸ¤– RAG: Here are some great sedans...

  [DEBUG]
    Vehicles Found: 5
    Retrieval Score: 78.45%
    Handoff: False
```

## Tips

1. **Start simple** - Test basic queries first ("I need a car")
2. **Test edge cases** - Try vague queries, specific models, budget-only
3. **Use clear often** - Reset context between different test scenarios
4. **Enable debug** - See what signals RAG is detecting
5. **Check stats** - Monitor message counts and session duration

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Database connection failed"
- Make sure your `.env` file is configured correctly
- Check that the database is running

### Error: "Dealership not found"
- Use `--dealership-id` flag with a valid dealership ID from your database

### Messages not persisting
- Check that the `conversations` table exists in your database
- Verify the test lead is being created successfully

## Development

The tool uses:
- **Database**: Real PostgreSQL tables (`leads`, `conversations`)
- **RAG Service**: Full EnhancedRAGService with retrieval
- **Context**: Loads full conversation history from database
- **Cleanup**: Deletes test lead and conversations on exit

## Notes

- Each session creates a new test lead with phone `+15005550001`
- All messages are stored in the database during the session
- On exit, the test lead and all messages are automatically deleted
- Uses ANSI color codes (works on most terminals)
