NEVER run sensitive API calls from the frontend
No secrets in .tsx or client-side code
“When possible, try to reuse or refactor existing functionality rather than adding new code”

“Never introduce a new technology without asking first. (e.g., changing from react to angular)”
“Make the minimal set of changes to achieve intended prompt”
