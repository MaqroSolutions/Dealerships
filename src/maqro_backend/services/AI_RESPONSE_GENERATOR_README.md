## üîß Implementation Details

### 1. Context Analysis (`ai_services.py`)

The system analyzes conversation context to understand customer needs:

```python
def analyze_conversation_context(conversations: List[Conversation]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Analyzes conversation to extract:
    - Customer intent (test_drive, pricing, availability, etc.)
    - Preferences (color, features, transmission, etc.)
    - Urgency level (high, medium, low)
    - Budget range
    - Vehicle type preference
    """
```

**Key Features:**
- Intent detection using keyword patterns
- Preference extraction from natural language
- Budget range parsing (e.g., "$20k-$30k", "25k to 35k")
- Urgency assessment based on language cues

### 2. Enhanced RAG Service (`rag_enhanced.py`)

Advanced vehicle retrieval with context-aware search:

```python
class EnhancedRAGService:
    def search_vehicles_with_context(
        self, 
        query: str, 
        conversations: List[Conversation],
        top_k: int = 5
    ) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """
        Performs multi-query search with context-based filtering and ranking
        """
```

**Advanced Features:**
- **Multi-Query Generation**: Creates multiple search queries based on context
- **Context Filtering**: Filters results based on budget, preferences, and intent
- **Dynamic Ranking**: Re-ranks results based on relevance to customer needs
- **Deduplication**: Removes duplicate vehicles from search results

### 3. Response Generation

Personalized response generation based on intent and context:

```python
def generate_contextual_ai_response(
    conversations: List[Conversation], 
    vehicles: List[Dict[str, Any]], 
    lead_name: str = None
) -> str:
    """
    Generates context-aware responses with:
    - Intent-specific formatting
    - Personalization
    - Call-to-action suggestions
    """
```

**Response Types:**
- **Test Drive Focused**: Emphasizes scheduling and availability
- **Pricing Focused**: Highlights pricing and financing options
- **Availability Focused**: Shows in-stock status and immediate action
- **General Inquiry**: Balanced information with multiple options

### 4. Quality Validation (`response_validation.py`)

Ensures response quality and provides fallbacks:

```python
class ResponseValidator:
    def validate_response(
        self, 
        response_data: Dict[str, Any], 
        original_query: str
    ) -> Tuple[bool, Dict[str, Any], Optional[str]]:
        """
        Validates response quality and provides fallback if needed
        """
```

**Quality Metrics:**
- **Relevance Score**: How well vehicles match the query
- **Completeness Score**: Response detail and information coverage
- **Personalization Score**: Use of customer context and preferences
- **Actionability Score**: Presence of clear next steps

## üìä Quality Metrics

### Response Quality Scoring

The system calculates quality scores across four dimensions:

1. **Relevance (0-1)**: How well vehicles match customer needs
2. **Completeness (0-1)**: Information coverage and detail
3. **Personalization (0-1)**: Use of customer context
4. **Actionability (0-1)**: Clear next steps and calls-to-action

### Performance Monitoring

The `ResponseQualityMonitor` tracks:
- Total responses generated
- High-quality response rate (score ‚â• 0.7)
- Fallback response usage
- Average quality score trends
- Common quality issues

## üîÑ Usage Examples

### Example 1: Test Drive Request
```python
# Customer: "I want to test drive a Toyota Camry under $30,000"

# Context Analysis
{
  "intent": "test_drive",
  "vehicle_type": "sedan",
  "budget_range": [0, 30000],
  "preferences": {"make": ["toyota"], "model": ["camry"]},
  "urgency": "medium"
}

# Generated Response
"Hi John! Great! I'd be happy to help you schedule a test drive. 
Here are 2 vehicles that match your criteria:
1. **2022 Toyota Camry** - $25,000
2. **2021 Toyota Camry** - $23,000

I can schedule a test drive for any of these vehicles. 
What's your preferred date and time?"
```

### Example 2: Pricing Inquiry
```python
# Customer: "What's the price of SUVs with leather seats?"

# Context Analysis
{
  "intent": "pricing",
  "vehicle_type": "suv",
  "preferences": {"features": ["leather"]},
  "urgency": "low"
}

# Generated Response
"Hi Sarah! Here are the pricing details for SUVs with leather seats:
1. **2022 Honda CR-V**
   Price: $28,500
2. **2021 Toyota RAV4**
   Price: $26,800

These prices are current and include all standard features. 
I can also provide financing options and payment estimates!"
```

## üöÄ Advanced Features

- Generated queries:
  - "sedan under $30k"
  - "sedan sedan under $30k"
  - "sedan $20k-$30k"
  - "sedan available for test drive"

### 2. Context-Based Filtering
Results are filtered based on:
- Budget constraints

- **General**: Balanced information with multiple options

### 4. Quality Assurance Pipeline
1. **Validation**: Check response quality metrics
2. **Enhancement**: Add missing elements (personalization, CTAs)
3. **Fallback**: Generate alternative responses if needed
4. **Monitoring**: Track performance over time

## üîß Configuration
